      The vite-src attribute points to the script entry point.
      The path is relative to the 'PackageDirectory' defined in appsettings.json (i.e., 'ClientApp').
      The tag helper will resolve this to the Vite dev server URL in development,
      or the compiled asset path from the manifest in production.
